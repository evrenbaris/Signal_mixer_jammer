This project demonstrates the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze the frequency components of mixed signals, including a target signal, a jammer signal, and noise. It visualizes the time-domain and frequency-domain representations of these signals, providing insights into their spectral properties.

Features

Signal Generation:

Target Signal: A sine wave at 50 Hz.

Jammer Signal: A sine wave at 80 Hz with a phase shift.

Noise: Random noise with configurable power.

Signal Mixing: Combines the target signal, jammer signal, and noise into a single mixed signal.

Visualization:

Time-domain plots for individual signals and the mixed signal.

Frequency-domain analysis using FFT to display magnitude spectra.
